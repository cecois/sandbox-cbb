    <p>This is primarily a map of every spatial reference from every <a href="http://www.earwolf.com/show/comedy-bang-bang/"><em>Comedy Bang! Bang!</em></a> episode ever recorded. Such as:
        <ul style="padding-left:10%;">
            <li>the probable location of the <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string="location_id:17 AND location_type:point"><span class="loc-string">Nordstrom that sold Danny Mahoney his heavy suicide coat</span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker cbb-trigger-inline"></i></span></li>
            <li>the very-difficult-to-actually-map location of <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string="location_id:410 AND location_type:point"><span class="loc-string">The Calvins Bee Honey Horse Fight Fields</span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker cbb-trigger-inline"></i></span></li>
            <li>JW Stillwater's route <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string="location_id:53 AND location_type:line"><span class="loc-string">from Cumberbatch County to L.A. via the Panama Canal</span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker cbb-trigger-inline"></i></span></li>
            <li>basically <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string="huell"><span class="loc-string">anything Huell Howser has ever said</span><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-map-marker cbb-trigger-inline"></i></span></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>...that sort of thing.</p>
    <p>But, ok -- technically, <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string='*:*'><span class="loc-string">all of the bits we've logged so far</span></span> are indexed here (not just the mappable ones), so you <em>could</em> consider this a master database of every individual trope and recurring CBB bit (e.g. <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string='bit:"Open Door Policy"'><span class="loc-string"><em>the CBB Open Door Policy</em></span></span>, <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string='bit:"Titular"'><span class="loc-string"><em>titular</em></span></span>, <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string='bit:"Cake Boss!"'><span class="loc-string"><em>"Cake Boss!"</em></span></span>, etc.). But this thing, as-is, focuses on the places and locations more than the entire universe of bits. See below for more about a potential larger scope.</p>
    
    <!--So while this thing technically does deliver
    , its primary purpose is to render . Such as:</p>
    <p>
        And for real the reason to do it is that the universe of CBB's characters - when canon - is so rich and sprawling that I wanted it all in one place, where I could wade into it from multiple angles, aspects, and facets. e.g. I wanted be able to visualize...
        So for now it's just a map of places that comprise the world of the CBB canon (and perhaps its diaspora).

        <div class="block slide3"><h1>BitTracker?!<span class="icom-bang" style="font-size:1.5em;"></span></h1>
                <p>
                    But you wanna talk more about this? Well, the ultimate idea is (eh, maybe was) to build a bittracker, for lack of a better name. <strong>Yeah, a <em>BitTracker</em></strong>. A tracker of bits. How many times (and when) <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string='bit:"My Wife!"'><span class="loc-string"><em>My Wife!</em></span></span>; how many times (and when) a <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string='bit:Classic WYR Blunder*'><span class="loc-string"><em>classic WYR blunder</em></span></span>. That sort of thing. But in a way that doesn't just list them out (or map them, when possible) but instead wraps some other methods of access around them -- a supercutter, for example (e.g. "click - supercut all the <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string='bit:Please Call Me \"Garry\"*'><span class="loc-string"><em>please call me Garrys</em></span></span> together" or "click - supercut all of <span class="copy-trigger" data-toggle="tooltip" data-string='bit:Ducca List'><span class="loc-string"><em>Bob Ducca's lists</em></span></span> together"). Or the original dream - something built on the SoundCloud copies of the episodes that lets everybody add/edit/annotate all this bullshit. So think something like the <a href="http://comedybangbang.wikia.com">CBB wikia</a>, but with a finer granularity and a more data-focused approach.</p></div></div>
    <!-- <div class="block"><h1>Is <em>Everything</em> Geocoded?</h1>
    <p>But no, not everything is in here. Yet. Once I realized I wanted to do this, I started re-listening from episode 1, logging locations instead of bits (which I'll pick back up later). I'm only through #143, so there will be plenty more added here in due time. I <em>may</em> add the ability for users to submit/edit locations, but that requires the addition of a whole other layer of app logic. The crowd-sourcing model will better suit the BitTracker anyway.</p></div> -->

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>As episodes are released, locations and bits will be added.</li>
                <li>As old episodes are revisited, missed locations and bits will be added.</li>
                <li>The web app might get an inline audio player (with or without annotation/edit capabilities).</li>
                <li>Some poor slob needs to build the full BitTracker still (and fold this into it).</li>
                <li>The crowd-sourcer component needs to be carefully designed, certainly based on the experience of just this mapping app -- e.g. it might behoove us to move the backend to a wiki platform and harvest all data <em>from</em> there (rather than continue to store bit- and location-level data in MongoDB and CartoDB instances, respectively, and handle the crowdsourcing pieces from custom-built code. The very useful <a href="http://comedybangbang.wikia.com">CBB wikia instance</a> could become a mutual asset, for instance.</li>
